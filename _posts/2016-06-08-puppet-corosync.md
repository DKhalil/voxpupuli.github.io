Yesterday, I have given a talk at [Puppet Camp Paris][PCP] about Types and
Providers development, based on my experience with the [puppet-corosync
module][GH]. It was a great opportunity to meet other contributors and users of
the modules, and other voxpupuli members.

The talk contained also some historical context about the module itself -
originally developed inside the Puppetlabs namespace, then moved last year under
voxpupuli. Since that move, we have successfully released a [1.0.0][1] release,
which was the result of an awesome collaborative work.

Please enjoy the slidedeck of the lecture below.
